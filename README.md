KDE AppStream Upstream Metadata Templates
=========================================

AppStream upstream metadata templates for KDE Applications.
These files have been automatically generated from public data available
about KDE applications.

/!\ The files are *not ready to take*! Every single one needs to be reviewed
carefully for validity and spec-compliance.
Also, the files might have to be extended accordingly to match each application,
and special care has to be taken on reviewing licenses.

You can find information on how to write good AppStream upstream metadata for
your KDE project (applications and frameworks) at: http://techbase.kde.org/MetaInfo
